	< Fixed debugger issue >
	Hello everyone.
	I'm a developer of Telegraph, and yesterday my debugger failed.
	After a long time (reinstalling AndroidStudio, components, editing xml settings) remained only one way - recreate project.
	So, i copied /src folder and all working (or looks like working).
	Why I need this daily ? I don't know. I only want to tell my ideas to somebody, and make hours of coding not so boring.
	I don't know, what Git will say about this, so I'll try to do everything right.
	Therefore, next commit must not contain phrases like 'fixed project recreating'.
	I dont think I need to describe project's state here, because short commit can contain everything, like in Twitter.
